.SH NAME
.B simple_shell
- simple command interpreter for UNIX-like systems.

.SH SYNOPSIS
usage: simple_shell

.SH DESCRIPTION
simple_shell is a command interpreter for the system. Reads lines from either a file or the terminal, interprets
them, and generally executes other commands. It incorporates many features to aid interactive use and has the advantage
of both interactive and non-interactive use (shell scripts). That is, commands can be typed directly to the running
shell or can be put into a file and the file can be executed directly by the shell.

.B Commads
    The shell interprets the words it reads. Essentially though, a line is read and if the first word of the
    line is a bult-in or an excecutable file then the shell has recognized a command.

.B Builtins
    This section lists the builtin commands which are builtin because they need to perform some operation that
    can't be performed by a separate process:

     exit
            Terminate the shell process.

     env
            Prints the environment
.SH BUGS
No known bugs.
